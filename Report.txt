1. Performance on the development data with 100% of the training data
1a. spam precision: 0.9930
1b. spam recall: 0.9774
1c. spam F1 score: 0.9851 
1d. ham precision: 0.9467
1e. ham recall: 0.9833
1f. ham F1 score: 0.9646

2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data
2a. spam precision: 0.9910
2b. spam recall: 0.9589
2c. spam F1 score: 0.9746
2d. ham precision: 0.9067
2e. ham recall: 0.9786
2f. ham F1 score: 0.9413

3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):

I remove punctuationd from the training data using nltk tokenizer, and also removed the stop words using nltk and used laplace smoothing with alpha=0.75 instead of add on smoothing. I also tried stemming but that decreased the spam precision and hence i removed it.

4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
